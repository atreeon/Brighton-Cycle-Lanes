Description
---
A collection of various changes to street design and discussions

Ethos
--
The design should be open for all to suggest alterations and comment on other suggestions.  The views should be open and accepting, non-judgemental.  The premise is that more suggestions give people a vision of the changes that may be possible and what they may look like.

Methodology
--
Keep problems and suggestions separate

1. If there is an issue with a part of the layout create an issue labelled as PROBLEM
2. If you have a potential suggestion then link to the above problem with a SUGGESTION

This way we separate our problems from our suggestions and don't confuse the two.  A problem can have many different suggestions.  A suggestion can aim to remedy many different suggestions.

Each suggestion or problem can be commented on many times and referenced many times.  Small problems and small solutions are preferred and can then be grouped together and linked to form larger problems and solutions.

Description: See images and map, solves #1

#### Google my maps
Very good for creating a route, highlighting points and areas and pictures related to specific areas.

For each 'suggestion', create a new layer in your map, prefix the layer description with the github id. 

It supports uploading KML / KMZ files, if anyone wants the KML / KMZ files can be added into github and history tracked.
