Description
---
A collection of various changes to street design and discussions

Ethos
--
The design should be open for all to suggest alterations and comment on other suggestions.  The views should be open and accepting, non-judgemental.  The premise is that more suggestions give people a vision of the changes that may be possible and what they may look like.

Methodology
--
Keep problems and solutions separate

1. If there is an issue with a part of the layout create an issue labelled as PROBLEM
2. If you have a potential solution then link to the above problem with a SUGGESTION

This way we separate our problems from our solutions and don't confuse the two.  A problem can have many different solutions.  A solution can aim to remedy many different solutions.

Each solution or problem can be commented on many times.
